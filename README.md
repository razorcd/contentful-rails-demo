## Contentful demo app

Synchronizes a local datastore with the remote Contentful datastore.

See [doc_api.md](https://github.com/razorcd/contentful-rails-demo/blob/master/doc_api.md) for all exposed endpoints.

## Development

- to run tests: `rspec`
- to clear VCR persisted requests: `rm spec/fixtures/vcr_cassettes/*`

##TODO

- [X] add method to recursively load sync data from Contentful API
- [X] add endpoint to trigger a sync that incrementally updates the local data
- [X] to completely reset the local data by triggering a full initial sync
- [X] sync deleted / modified and new records. Use `nextSyncUrl` to update only the changes
- [X] sync Category with Product relation
- [ ] sync Brand with Product relation
- [ ] ensure recursive sync (nextPageUrl) is functional (reduce elements count per request)
- [ ] add FactoryGirl for functional tests
- [ ] models: add validations and unit tests
- [X] sync assets
- [ ] add integration tests
- [ ] add CI with Travis and deploy to Heroku

##Other

In a real life application the `contentful - local sotre` synchronization would be done in a background job to not block the main process by doing external requests (`/sync`).
